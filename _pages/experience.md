### PhD student
- Company: Inria, Université de Lorraine (Nancy, France)
- Period: Dec 2012 - Feb 2016
- Project: [RAPSODIE](http://www.erocca.com/rapsodie/rapsodie/), Speech recognition as a communication aid for deaf and hearing impaired people
- Mission: This thesis aimed to study, deepen and enrich the extraction of lexical and para-lexical information from speech in order to help communication with deaf and hearing impaired people. Regarding the lexical modeling, we focused on optimizing the choice of lexical units defining the vocabulary and the associated language model; we then proposed the use of a hybrid language model combining words with syllables. Another focus was on adding new words into the language model; we proposed and evaluated a new approach based on a principle of similarity between words (words having similar neighbor distributions). Regarding the extraction of para-lexical information, we focused mainly on the detection of questions and statements, using prosodic and linguistic information.
- Technical environment: Linux, Perl, Shell Script, Gnuplot, LaTeX, Git, distributed computing platform
- Keywords: speech recognition, embedded system, hybrid language model, out-of-vocabulary words, similar words, question detection

### Expert Engineer
- Company: Inria (Nancy, France)
- Period: Oct 2011 - Dec 2012
- Project: [ALLEGRO](http://www.allegro-project.eu/), Speech recognition for second language learning
- Mission: This work focused on the detection of incorrect entries (i.e. those for which the text does not correspond to the associated speech signal) of non-native speech in the context of foreign language learning. The proposed approach exploits the comparison between two text-to-speech alignments: one constrained by the text which is being checked (forced alignment), with another one unconstrained, corresponding to a phonetic decoding (using a phoneme loop or a word loop). The comparison takes into account the phonemes, the frames, the non-speech segments, the likelihood ratios and the phoneme durations.
- Technical environment: Linux, Perl, Shell Script, Gnuplot, LaTeX
- Keywords: speech recognition, foreign language learning, incorrect entries, non-native speech, constrained and unconstrained alignments, logistic regression

### Intern
- University: Université de Lorraine (Nancy, France)
- Period: Feb 2011 - Juin 2011
- Title: Speech recognition with remote sound for a home automation system
- Abstract: This work focused on evaluating the performance of a speech recognition system with remote sound. We tested different configurations, different decoding settings, different acoustic and language models in order to determine the setup leading to optimal performance.
- Technical environment: Linux, Java, Perl, Shell Script
- Keywords: speech recognition, remote sound, adaptation, optimal settings

### Intern
- University: Universitatea 'Stefan cel Mare' (Suceava, Romania)
- Period: Feb 2010 - Juin 2010
- Title: Acquisition and recognition of head movements for the gesture control in video games
- Abstract: This work was based on the idea that users get emotionally involved while controling the actions of video games though unconscious body movements; and these unconsciouns movements can be detected and used as the actual (natural) control of the game. We hence developped a new way of tracking head movements which can learn useful gestures to control a video game. The demonstration was performed using a Wii remote that tracks the head position through glasses equipped with IR LEDs.
- Technical environment: Windows, C#, Microsoft Visual Studio
- Keywords: head movements, Wii remote, infrared sensors
